REPERTORIES :
	rax - eax - ax - ah -al:Values are returned from functions in this register.  
	rcx : scratch register, often the counter
	
	rbx |\
	rsp |-> preserved registers
	rbp |/

Arg	1 :	RDI - edi - di - dil
	2 :	RSI - esi - si - sil
	3 :	RDX - edx - dx - dl
	4 :	RCX - ecx - cx - cl
	5 :	R8
	6 :	R9

“byte”			refers to a one-byte integer
“word”			refers to a two-byte integer
“doubleword”	refers to a four-byte integer
“quadword”		refers to an eight-byte value
Any time the assembler can figure the size out automatically, they are optional


square brackets mean to then take that result and treat it like an address to a location in memory

To init a value : "xor rax, rax" = init rax at 0
				or "mov rax, 0"

PUSH a value (or a register) will write it on the stack.
	The value can still be accessed after being pushed, but can now be overwritten because its in a safe place
every PUSH has to be followed somewhere by a POP. NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SAME REGISTER
example :	push	RDI
			pop		RSI -> puts what we've pushed into RSI

jz		jump if zero
je		jump if equal
jb				below
ja		jump if above
jnz				non-zero

SYSCALL will ask the OS to perform a service (exit, fork, write, read, open, close,...)
	it handles ERRORs
